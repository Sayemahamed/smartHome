## Project Overview

This smart home system enables hands-free control of essential home appliances. Using voice recognition technology, the system interprets specific commands and relays them to an Arduino Uno microcontroller, which then activates or deactivates connected devices.

The project is built with C++ and PlatformIO, allowing for a structured development environment and easy code management. It leverages an Arduino Uno to handle the inputs and outputs for the connected devices and a voice module for recognizing commands.

## Features

- **Voice-Controlled Operations**: Control lights, fans, and other appliances via voice commands.
- **Multi-Device Support**: Connect multiple home appliances and operate them independently.
- **Low Power Consumption**: Optimized for efficient energy usage with standby mode.
- **Customizable Commands**: Easy to add new commands or modify existing ones.
- **PlatformIO Integrated**: Build and upload code seamlessly with PlatformIO.

## Hardware Requirements

- **Arduino Uno** (1 unit)
- **Voice Recognition Module** (e.g., Elechouse Voice Recognition Module)
- **Relay Modules** (1 per device you want to control)
- **Breadboard and Jumper Wires** for prototyping connections
- **Connected Appliances** (e.g., lights, fans)

## Software Requirements

- **PlatformIO**: For managing dependencies and uploading code
- **Arduino IDE**: (optional) For code review and additional debugging
- **C++**: Programming language for embedded development

## Setup and Installation

1. **Install PlatformIO**:
   - Install PlatformIO as a Visual Studio Code extension or as a standalone CLI tool.
   - Refer to the official [PlatformIO installation guide](https://platformio.org/install).

2. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/smart-home-arduino.git
   cd smart-home-arduino
   ```

3. **Connect Hardware**:
   - Follow the wiring diagram to connect your Arduino Uno to the relay module and voice recognition module.
   - Plug in each appliance to the relay module ports.

4. **Upload Code to Arduino**:
   - Open the project in PlatformIO and select the Arduino Uno as your development board.
   - Upload the code by selecting the "Upload" button in PlatformIO or using the CLI:
     ```bash
     pio run --target upload
     ```

5. **Configure Voice Commands**:
   - Train the voice recognition module using the manufacturer’s instructions to recognize commands such as “Turn on light” or “Turn off fan.”

## Usage

1. **Power On the System**: Plug in your Arduino Uno with the setup.
2. **Use Voice Commands**: Speak a command to operate connected appliances. For example:
   - **“Turn on light”**: Activates the light relay.
   - **“Turn off fan”**: Deactivates the fan relay.

3. **Add New Commands**:
   - Modify the source code to add new commands and upload the updated code.
